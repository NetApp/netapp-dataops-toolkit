NetApp DataOps Toolkit for Traditional Environments
=========

The NetApp DataOps Toolkit for Traditional Environments is a Python library that makes it simple for developers, data scientists, DevOps engineers, and data engineers to perform various data management tasks, such as provisioning a new data volume, near-instantaneously cloning a data volume, and near-instantaneously snapshotting a data volume for traceability/baselining. This Python library can function as either a [command line utility](#command-line-functionality) or a [library of functions](#library-of-functions) that can be imported into any Python program or Jupyter Notebook.

## Compatibility

The NetApp DataOps Toolkit for Traditional Environments supports Linux and macOS hosts.

The toolkit must be used in conjunction with a data storage system or service in order to be useful. The toolkit simplifies the performing of various data management tasks that are actually executed by the data storage system or service. In order to facilitate this, the toolkit communicates with the data storage system or service via API. The toolkit is currently compatible with the following storage systems and services:

- NetApp AFF (running ONTAP 9.7 and above)
- NetApp FAS (running ONTAP 9.7 and above)
- NetApp Cloud Volumes ONTAP (running ONTAP 9.7 and above)
- NetApp ONTAP Select (running ONTAP 9.7 and above)

Note: The 'prepopulate flexcache' operation only supports ONTAP 9.8 and above. All other operations support ONTAP 9.7 and above.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

The NetApp DataOps Toolkit for Traditional Environments requires that Python 3.6 or above be installed on the local host. Additionally, the toolkit requires that pip for Python3 be installed on the local host. For more details regarding pip, including installation instructions, refer to the [pip documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

### Installation Instructions

To install the NetApp DataOps Toolkit for Traditional Environments, run the following command.

```sh
python3 -m pip install netapp-dataops-traditional
```

<a name="getting-started"></a>

## Getting Started

A config file must be created before the NetApp Data Management Toolkit for Traditional Environments can be used to perform data management operations. To create a config file, run the following command. This command will create a config file named 'config.json' in '~/.netapp_dataops/'.

```sh
netapp_dataops_cli.py config
```

Note: The toolkit requires an ONTAP account with API access. The toolkit will use this account to access the ONTAP API. NetApp recommends using an SVM-level account. Usage of a cluster admin account should be avoided for security reasons.

#### Example Usage

### Data Volume Management Operations

<a name="cli-clone-volume"></a>

#### Clone a Data Volume

The NetApp DataOps Toolkit can be used to near-instantaneously create a new data volume that is an exact copy of an existing volume. This functionality utilizes NetApp FlexClone technology. This means that any clones created will be extremely storage-space-efficient. Aside from metadata, a clone will not consume additional storage space until its contents starts to deviate from the source volume. The command for cloning a data volume is `netapp_dataops_cli.py clone volume`.

The following options/arguments are required:

```
    -n, --name=             Name of new volume..
    -v, --source-volume=    Name of volume to be cloned.
```

The following options/arguments are optional:

```
    -u, --cluster-name=     non default hosting cluster
    -c, --source-svm=       non default source svm name
    -t, --target-svm=       non default target svm name
    -g, --gid=              Unix filesystem group id (gid) to apply when creating new volume (if not specified, gid of source volume will be retained) (Note: cannot apply gid of '0' when creating clone).
    -h, --help              Print help text.
    -m, --mountpoint=       Local mountpoint to mount new volume at after creating. If not specified, new volume will not be mounted locally. On Linux hosts - if specified, must be run as root.
    -s, --source-snapshot=  Name of the snapshot to be cloned (if specified, the clone will be created from a specific snapshot on the source volume as opposed to the current state of the volume).
                            when snapshot name suffixed with * the latest snapshot will be used (hourly* will use the latest snapshot prefixed with hourly )
    -u, --uid=              Unix filesystem user id (uid) to apply when creating new volume (if not specified, uid of source volume will be retained) (Note: cannot apply uid of '0' when creating clone).
    -x, --readonly          Read-only option for mounting volumes locally.
    -j, --junction          Specify a custom junction path for the volume to be exported at.
    -e, --export-hosts               colon(:) seperated hosts/cidrs to to use for export. hosts will be exported for rw and root access
    -e, --export-policy              export policy name to attach to the volume, default policy will be used if export-hosts/export-policy not provided
    -d, --snapshot-policy            snapshot-policy to attach to the volume, default snapshot policy will be used if not provided
    -s, --split              start clone split after creation
    -r, --refresh            delete existing clone if exists before creating a new one
    -d, --svm-dr-unprotect           disable svm dr protection if svm-dr protection exists
```

##### Example Usage

Create a volume named 'project2' that is an exact copy of the volume 'project1'.

```sh
netapp_dataops_cli.py clone volume --name=project2 --source-volume=project1
Creating clone volume 'project2' from source volume 'project1'.
Clone volume created successfully.
```

Create a volume named 'project2' that is an exact copy of the volume 'project1', and locally mount the newly created volume at '~/project2' as read-write.

```sh
netapp_dataops_cli.py clone volume --name=project2 --source-volume=project1 --mountpoint=~/project2 --readonly

```

<a name="cli-list-volumes"></a>

#### List All Data Volumes

The NetApp DataOps Toolkit can be used to print a list of all existing data volumes. The command for printing a list of all existing data volumes is `netapp_dataops_cli.py list volumes`.

No options/arguments are required for this command.

The following options/arguments are optional:

```
    -u, --cluster-name=                 non default hosting cluster

    -s, --include-space-usage-details   Include storage space usage details in output (see README for explanation).
```

##### Storage Space Usage Details Explanation

If the -s/--include-space-usage-details  option is specified, then four additional columns will be included in the output. These columns will be titled 'Snap Reserve', 'Capacity', 'Usage', and 'Footprint'. These columns and their relation to the 'Size' column are explained in the table below.

| Column        | Explanation                                                                                                                        |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Size          | The logical size of the volume.                                                                                                    |
| Snap Reserve  | The percentage of the volume's logical size that is reserved for snapshot copies.                                                  |
| Capacity      | The logical capacity that is available for users of the volume to store data in.                                                   |
| Usage         | The combined logical size of all of the files that are stored on the volume.                                                       |
| Footprint     | The actual on-disk storage space that is being consumed by the volume after all ONTAP storage efficiencies are taken into account. |

The 'Footprint' value will differ from the 'Usage' value. In some cases, particularly with clone volumes, the 'Footprint' value will be smaller than the 'Usage' value due to ONTAP storage efficiencies. These storage efficiencies include FlexClone technology, deduplication, compression, etc. In the case that the 'Footprint' value is smaller than the 'Usage' value, the delta between the two is a rough representation of the on-disk space savings that you are receiving from ONTAP storage efficiencies.

Note that the 'Footprint' value includes the on-disk storage space that is being consumed by all of the volume's snapshot copies in addition to the on-disk storage space that is being consumed by the data that is currently stored on the volume. If a volume has many snapshots, then the snapshots may represent a large portion of the 'Footprint' value.

Also note that if you are using an ONTAP version earlier than 9.9, then the 'Footprint' value will only be reported for 'flexvol' volumes.

```

<a name="cli-unmount-volume"></a>

#### Unmount an Existing Data Volume

The NetApp DataOps Toolkit can be used to unmount an existing data volume that is currently on your local host. The command for unmounting an existing volume is `netapp_dataops_cli.py unmount volume`. If executed on a Linux host, this command must be run as root. It is usually not necessary to run this command as root on macOS hosts.

The following options/arguments are required:

```
    -m, --mountpoint=       Mountpoint where volume is mounted at.
```

##### Example Usage

Unmount the volume that is currently mounted at '/test1' on your local host.

```sh

[sudo] password for ai:
Unmounting volume at '/test1'.
Volume unmounted successfully.
```

### Snapshot Management Operations

<a name="cli-create-snapshot"></a>

#### Create a New Snapshot for a Data Volume

The NetApp DataOps Toolkit can be used to near-instantaneously save a space-efficient, read-only copy of an existing data volume. These read-only copies are called snapshots. This functionality can be used to version datasets and/or implement dataset-to-model traceability. The command for creating a new snapshot for a specific data volume is `netapp_dataops_cli.py create snapshot`.

The following options/arguments are required:

```
    -v, --volume=   Name of volume.
```

The following options/arguments are optional:

```
    -u, --cluster-name=      non default hosting cluster
    -s, --svm=               Non defaul svm name.
    -n, --name=              Name of new snapshot. If not specified, will be set to 'netapp_dataops_<timestamp>'.
    -r, --retention=         Snapshot name will be suffixed by <timestamp> and excesive snapshots will be deleted.
                             Can be count of snapshots when int (ex. 10) or days when retention is suffixed by d (ex. 10d)
    -l, --snapmirror-label=  if proivded snapmirror label will be configured on the created snapshot   
    -h, --help               Print help text.
```

##### Example Usage

Create a snapshot named 'final_dataset' for the volume named 'test1'.

```sh
netapp_dataops_cli.py create snapshot --volume=test1 --name=final_dataset
Creating snapshot 'final_dataset'.
Snapshot created successfully.
```

Create a snapshot for the volume named 'test1'.

```sh
netapp_dataops_cli.py create snapshot -v test1
Creating snapshot 'netapp_dataops_20201113_125210'.

### Data Volume Management Operations

<a name="lib-clone-volume"></a>

#### Clone a Data Volume

The NetApp DataOps Toolkit can be used to near-instantaneously create a new data volume that is an exact copy of an existing volume as part of any Python program or workflow. This functionality utilizes NetApp FlexClone technology. This means that any clones created will be extremely storage-space-efficient. Aside from metadata, a clone will not consume additional storage space until its contents starts to deviate from the source volume.

##### Function Definition

```py
def clone_volume(
    new_volume_name: str,                  # Name of new volume (required).
    source_volume_name: str,               # Name of volume to be cloned (required).
    cluster_name: str = None,              # non default cluster name, same credentials as the default credentials should be used 
    source_snapshot_name: str = None,      # Name of the snapshot to be cloned (if specified, the clone will be created from a specific snapshot on the source volume as opposed to the current state of the volume). if snapshot name is suffixed by * the latest snapsho starting with the prefix specified will be used (daily* will use the latest snapshot prefixed by daily)
    source_svm: str = None,                # Name of of the svm hosting the volume to be cloned, when not provided default svm will be used
    target_svm: str = None,                # Name of of the svm hosting the clone. when not provided source svm will be used 
    export_hosts: str = None,              # colon(:) seperated hosts/cidrs to to use for export. hosts will be exported for rw and root access
    export_policy: str = None,             # export policy name to attach to the volume, default policy will be used if export-hosts/export-policy not provided
    snapshot_policy: str = None,           # name of existing snapshot policy to configure on the volume 
    split: bool = False,                   # start clone split after creation
    unix_uid: str = None,                  # Unix filesystem user id (uid) to apply when creating new volume (if not specified, uid of source volume will be retained) (Note: cannot apply uid of '0' when creating clone).
    unix_gid: str = None,                  # Unix filesystem group id (gid) to apply when creating new volume (if not specified, gid of source volume will be retained) (Note: cannot apply gid of '0' when creating clone).
    mountpoint: str = None,                # Local mountpoint to mount new volume at. If not specified, volume will not be mounted locally. On Linux hosts - if specified, calling program must be run as root.
    junction: str= None,                   # Custom junction path for volume to be exported at. If not specified, junction path will be: ("/"+Volume Name).
    readonly: bool = False,                # Option to mount volume locally as "read-only." If not specified volume will be mounted as "read-write". On Linux hosts - if specified, calling program must be run as root.
    refresh: bool = False,                 # when true a previous clone using this name will be deleted prior to the new clone creation
    svm_dr_unprotect: bool = False,        # mark the clone created to be excluded from svm-dr replication when onfigured on the clone svm 
    print_output: bool = False             # print log to the console
)
```

##### Return Value

None

##### Error Handling

If an error is encountered, the function will raise an exception of one of the following types. These exception types are defined in `netapp_dataops.traditional`.

<a name="lib-list-volumes"></a>

#### List All Data Volumes

The NetApp DataOps Toolkit can be used to retrieve a list of all existing data volumes as part of any Python program or workflow.

##### Function Definition

```py
def list_volumes(
    check_local_mounts: bool = False,           # If set to true, then the local mountpoints of any mounted volumes will be included in the returned list and included in printed output.
    include_space_usage_details: bool = False,  # Include storage space usage details in output (see below for explanation).
    cluster_name: str = None,        # Non default cluster name, same credentials as the default credentials should be used 
    svm_name: str = None,            # Non default svm name, same credentials as the default credentials should be used    
    print_output: bool = False                  # Denotes whether or not to print messages to the console during execution.
) -> list() :
```

##### Storage Space Usage Details Explanation

If `include_space_usage_details` is set to `True`, then four additional fields will be included in the output. These fields will be labeled with the keys 'Snap Reserve', 'Capacity', 'Usage', and 'Footprint'. These fields and their relation to the 'Size' field are explained in the table below.

| Field         | Explanation                                                                                                                        |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Size          | The logical size of the volume.                                                                                                    |
| Snap Reserve  | The percentage of the volume's logical size that is reserved for snapshot copies.                                                  |
| Capacity      | The logical capacity that is available for users of the volume to store data in.                                                   |
| Usage         | The combined logical size of all of the files that are stored on the volume.                                                       |
| Footprint     | The actual on-disk storage space that is being consumed by the volume after all ONTAP storage efficiencies are taken into account. |

The 'Footprint' value will differ from the 'Usage' value. In some cases, particularly with clone volumes, the 'Footprint' value will be smaller than the 'Usage' value due to ONTAP storage efficiencies. These storage efficiencies include FlexClone technology, deduplication, compression, etc. In the case that the 'Footprint' value is smaller than the 'Usage' value, the delta between the two is a rough representation of the on-disk space savings that you are receiving from ONTAP storage efficiencies.

Note that the 'Footprint' value includes the on-disk storage space that is being consumed by all of the volume's snapshot copies in addition to the on-disk storage space that is being consumed by the data that is currently stored on the volume. If a volume has many snapshots, then the snapshots may represent a large portion of the 'Footprint' value.

Also note that if you are using an ONTAP version earlier than 9.9, then the 'Footprint' value will only be reported for 'flexvol' volumes.

##### Return Value

The function returns a list of all existing volumes. Each item in the list will be a dictionary containing details regarding a specific volume. The keys for the values in this dictionary are "Volume Name", "Logical Size", "Type", "NFS Mount Target", "FlexCache" (yes/no), "Clone" (yes/no), "Source Volume", "Source Snapshot". If `check_local_mounts` is set to `True`, then "Local Mountpoint" will also be included as a key in the dictionary. If `include_space_usage_details` is set to `True`, then "Snap Reserve", "Capacity", "Usage", and "Footprint" will also be included as keys in the dictionary.

##### Error Handling

If an error is encountered, the function will raise an exception of one of the following types. These exception types are defined in `netapp_dataops.traditional`.

```py
InvalidConfigError              # Config file is missing or contains an invalid value.
APIConnectionError              # The storage system/service API returned an error.
```

<a name="lib-mount-volume"></a>

#### Mount an Existing Data Volume Locally

The NetApp DataOps Toolkit can be used to mount an existing data volume as "read-only" or "read-write" on your local host as part of any Python program or workflow. On Linux hosts, mounting requires root privileges, so any Python program that invokes this function must be run as root. It is usually not necessary to invoke this function as root on macOS hosts.

##### Function Definition

```py
def mount_volume(
    volume_name: str,           # Name of volume (required).
    cluster_name: str = None,        # Non default cluster name, same credentials as the default credentials should be used 
    svm_name: str = None,            # Non default svm name, same credentials as the default credentials should be used    
    mountpoint: str,            # Local mountpoint to mount volume at (required).
    readonly: bool = False,     # Mount volume locally as "read-only." If not specified volume will be mounted as "read-write". On Linux hosts - if specified, calling program must be run as root.
    print_output: bool = False  # Denotes whether or not to print messages to the console during execution.
) :
```

##### Return Value

None

##### Error Handling

def prepopulate_flex_cache(
    volume_name: str,           # Name of FlexCache volume (required).
    paths: list,                # List of dirpaths/filepaths to prepopulate (required).
    print_output: bool = False
) :
```

##### Return Value

None

##### Error Handling

If an error is encountered, the function will raise an exception of one of the following types. These exception types are defined in `netapp_dataops.traditional`.

```py
InvalidConfigError              # Config file is missing or contains an invalid value.
APIConnectionError              # The storage system/service API returned an error.
InvalidVolumeParameterError     # An invalid parameter was specified.
```

<a name="lib-list-snapmirror-relationships"></a>

#### List All SnapMirror Relationships

The NetApp DataOps Toolkit can be used to retrieve a list of all existing SnapMirror relationships for which the destination volume resides on the user's storage system, as part of any Python program or workflow.

Note: To create a new SnapMirror relationship, access ONTAP System Manager.

##### Function Definition

```py
def list_snap_mirror_relationships(
    cluster_name: str = None,    # Non default cluster name, same credentials as the default credentials should be used 
    svm_name: str = None,        # Non default svm name, same credentials as the default credentials should be used    
    print_output: bool = False   # Denotes whether or not to print messages to the console during execution.
) -> list() :
```

##### Return Value

The function returns a list of all existing SnapMirror relationships for which the destination volume resides on the user's storage system. Each item in the list will be a dictionary containing details regarding a specific SnapMirror relationship. The keys for the values in this dictionary are "UUID", "Type", "Healthy", "Current Transfer Status", "Source Cluster", "Source SVM", "Source Volume", "Dest Cluster", "Dest SVM", "Dest Volume".

##### Error Handling

If an error is encountered, the function will raise an exception of one of the following types. These exception types are defined in `netapp_dataops.traditional`.

```py
InvalidConfigError              # Config file is missing or contains an invalid value.
APIConnectionError              # The storage system/service API returned an error.
```

<a name="lib-sync-snapmirror-relationship"></a>

#### Trigger a Sync Operation for an Existing SnapMirror Relationship

The NetApp DataOps Toolkit can be used to trigger a sync operation for an existing SnapMirror relationshp for which the destination volume resides on the user's storage system, as part of any Python program or workflow. NetApp's SnapMirror volume replication technology can be used to quickly and efficiently replicate data between NetApp storage systems. For example, SnapMirror could be used to replicate newly acquired data, gathered on a different NetApp storage system, to the user's NetApp storage system to be used for AI/ML model training or retraining.

Tip: Use the listSnapMirrorRelationships() function to obtain the UUID.

Note: To create a new SnapMirror relationship, access ONTAP System Manager or use the createSnapMirrorRelationships()

##### Function Definition

```py
def sync_snap_mirror_relationship(
    uuid: str,                          # UUID of the relationship for which the sync operation is to be triggered (required).
    volume_name: str = None             # destination volume name (only when uuid not provided)
    cluster_name: str = None,           # Non default cluster name, same credentials as the default credentials should be used 
    svm_name: str = None,               # Non default svm name, same credentials as the default credentials should be used    
    wait_until_complete: bool = False,  # Denotes whether or not to wait for sync operation to complete before returning.
    print_output: bool = False          # Denotes whether or not to print messages to the console during execution.
) :
```

##### Return Value

None

#### Create New SnapMirror Relationship

The NetApp DataOps Toolkit can be used to create SnapMirror relationshp for which the destination volume resides on the user's storage system. NetApp's SnapMirror volume replication technology can be used to quickly and efficiently replicate data between NetApp storage systems. For example, SnapMirror could be used to replicate newly acquired data, gathered on a different NetApp storage system, to the user's NetApp storage system to be used for AI/ML model training or retraining. The command can create relationship and initialize/resync the relationship. 

##### Function Definition

```py
def create_snap_mirror_relationship(
    source_svm: str,                    # snapmirror replication source svm name 
    source_vol: str,                    # snapmirror replication source volume name 
    target_svm: str = None,             # snapmirror replication target svm name 
    target_vol: str,                    # snapmirror replication target volume name, when not provided default svm will be used
    cluster_name: str = None,           # Non default cluster name, same credentials as the default credentials should be used     
    schedule: str = '',                 # name of the schedule to use, when not provided no schedule will be provided 
    policy: str = 'MirrorAllSnapshots', # snapmirror poilcy to use, when not provided MirrorAllSnapshots will be used 
    action: str = None,                 # the action to perform after the creation of the snapmirror relationship. can be: initialize or resync. initialize can be used to initialize new replication (requires destination volume to be of DP type). resync can be used to resync volumes with common snapshot
    print_output: bool = False          # Denotes whether or not to print messages to the console during execution.
