NetApp DataOps Toolkit data mover package.

<a id="netapp_dataops.k8s.data_movers.DataMoverJob"></a>

## DataMoverJob Objects

```python
class DataMoverJob()
```

Manage Kubernetes jobs intended for moving data between locations.

This class is meant to provide an interface to create a K8s job to be used
to move data to or from a volume in Kubernetes. It is unlikely that you
want to use this class directly. Instead use a derived class from this.

<a id="netapp_dataops.k8s.data_movers.DataMoverJob.__init__"></a>

#### \_\_init\_\_

```python
def __init__(namespace: str = "default", job_spec_template: V1JobSpec = None, print_output: bool = False)
```

Initialize a DataMoverJob object.

**Arguments**:

- `namespace`: The namespace which applies to the job. Defaults to the default namespace.
- `job_spec_template`: A Kubernetes job spec object. This can be used to configure any of the
optional properties of a job spec if desired. It is intended that this can be used as a template
to provide optional parameters of the V1JobSpec object. Derived classes should use a copy of the
job spec and replace the required template field with the appropriate pod template spec for the
particular operation being performed.
- `print_output`: If True enable information to be printed to the console. Default value is False.

<a id="netapp_dataops.k8s.data_movers.DataMoverJob.job_spec"></a>

#### job\_spec

```python
@property
def job_spec() -> V1JobSpec
```

Get a deep copy of the object's job_spec template.

def create_job(job_metadata: V1ObjectMeta, job_spec: V1JobSpec) -> V1Job
```

Create a Kubernetes job.

**Returns**:

The V1Job object representing the created job.

<a id="netapp_dataops.k8s.data_movers.DataMoverJob.delete_job"></a>

#### delete\_job

```python
def delete_job(job: str)
```

Delete the Kubernetes job with the provided name.

This will delete the job with the provided name regardless of the status of the job.
If you want to avoid deleting a job that has not completed then make sure to check
the status of the job before using this function.

**Arguments**:

- `job`: The name of the job to delete.

#### did\_job\_fail

```python
def did_job_fail(job: str) -> bool
```

Get an indication if the job failed or not.

A job is considered failed if one or more pods associated with the job ended in a failed
state.

Note: If the failed status of a job is false that may not mean it succeeded. This will
return False if the job has not completed. To be sure of the job status check if the job
is active or not first, and then check if the job succeeded or failed.

**Arguments**:

- `job`: The name of the job.

**Returns**:

True if the job failed and False otherwise.

<a id="netapp_dataops.k8s.data_movers.DataMoverJob.did_job_succeed"></a>

#### did\_job\_succeed

```python
def did_job_succeed(job: str) -> bool
```

Get an indication if the job succeeded or not.

This will return True if one or more pods associated with the job ended with a successful
state.

Note: If the success status of the job is false that may not mean the job failed. This
will return False if the job has not completed. To be sure of the job status check if the
job is active or not first, and then check if the job succeeded or failed.

**Arguments**:

- `job`: The name of the job.

**Returns**:

True if the job succeeded and False otherwise.

default. For example if the S3 service is using a self-signed certificate.
- `cpu_request`: The amount of cpu to request for the container associated with a job. The request
is used to help schedule the job's pod placement and reserves resources for the job. The value is
the Kubernetes cpu unit as a string. An example would be "200m". If the cpu_request parameter is not
set then no cpu request is used with the jobs.
- `cpu_limit`: The amount of cpu to use as a maximum limit for the container associated with a job.
The job will not be allowed to use more cpu than what is specified here. The value is the Kubernetes
cpu unit as a string. An example would be "500m". If the cpu_limit parameter is not set then no cpu
limit is used with the jobs.
- `memory_request`: The amount of memory to request for use for the container associated with a job.
The request is used to help schedule the job's pod placement and reserve resources for the job. The
value is a string representing the amount of memory in bytes, or in the unit specified by the suffix
used. An example would be "100M". If the memory_request parameter is not set then no memory request
is used with the jobs.
- `memory_limit`: The amount of memory to set as the limit of memory used by a job. The job will not
be allowed to use more memory than what is specified as the memory limit. The value is a string
representing the amount of memory in bytes, or in the unit specified by the suffux used. An
example would be "500M". If the memory_limit parameter is not set then no memory limit is used
with the jobs.
- `print_output`: If True enable information to be printed to the console. Default value is False.
