NetApp DataOps Toolkit
=========

The NetApp DataOps Toolkit is a Python library that makes it simple for developers, data scientists, DevOps engineers, and data engineers to perform various data management tasks, such as near-instantaneously provisioning a new data volume or JupyterLab workspace, near-instantaneously cloning a data volume or JupyterLab workspace, and near-instantaneously snapshotting a data volume or JupyterLab workspace for traceability/baselining. This Python library can function as either a command line utility or a library of functions that can be imported into any Python program or Jupyter Notebook.

## Getting Started

The NetApp DataOps Toolkit comes in two different flavors - one for Kubernetes-based environments, and one for traditional VM-based or bare-metal environments. Choose the appropriate flavor to use based on your specific environment and use case.

- [NetApp DataOps Toolkit for Kubernetes](netapp_dataops_k8s/)
- [NetApp DataOps Toolkit for Traditional Environments](netapp_dataops_traditional/)
