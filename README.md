NetApp DataOps Toolkit
=========

The NetApp DataOps Toolkit is a Python library that makes it simple for developers, data scientists, DevOps engineers, and data engineers to perform various data management tasks, such as near-instantaneously provisioning a new data volume or JupyterLab workspace, near-instantaneously cloning a data volume or JupyterLab workspace, and near-instantaneously snapshotting a data volume or JupyterLab workspace for traceability/baselining. This Python library can function as either a command line utility or a library of functions that can be imported into any Python program or Jupyter Notebook.

## Getting Started

The latest stable release of the NetApp DataOps Toolkit is version 2.2.0. It is recommended to always use the latest stable release. You can access the documentation for the latest stable release [here](https://github.com/NetApp/netapp-dataops-toolkit/tree/v2.2.0)

The NetApp DataOps Toolkit comes in two different flavors - one for Kubernetes-based environments, and one for traditional VM-based or bare-metal environments. Choose the appropriate flavor to use based on your specific environment and use case.
