# Kubeflow Examples
This directory contains examples that demonstrate how the NetApp Data Science Toolkit can be used in conjunction with [Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org).

Examples are categorized as follows:

- [Jupyter Notebooks](Notebooks/): Example Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate the execution of NetApp Data Science Toolkit for Kubernetes operations from within a notebook environment. These notebooks are intended to be used within a Notebook Server that was provisioned using Kubeflow but may also be compatible with other Kubernetes-based Jupyter Notebook implementations/deployments.
- [Kubeflow Pipelines](Pipelines/): Example pipeline definitions that show how NetApp data management functions can be incorporated into automated workflows that are orchestrated using the Kubeflow Pipelines framework.
